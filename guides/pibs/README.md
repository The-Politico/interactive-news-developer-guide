# The POLITICO Interactives Build Suite

The POLITICO Interactives Build Suite \(PIBS\) is a collection of libraries that power the creation of our off-platform web pages in 2019. These libraries include:

* [`@politico/interactive-bin`](https://github.com/The-Politico/politico-interactive-bin) \(pib\)
* [`@politico/interactive-templates`](https://github.com/The-Politico/politico-interactive-templates) \(pit\)
* `@politico/interactive-style` \(coming soon...\)
* [`@politico/interactive-code-snippets`](https://github.com/The-Politico/politico-interactive-code-snippets)
* [`@politico/eslint-config-interactives`](https://github.com/The-Politico/eslint-config-interactives)

Rather than explain what each one does individually, this guide will focus using them in tandem. \(For a more detailed explanation on how to use each, check out their respective docs.\)
