# Interactive Templates

There are a number of templates created by our team. Here are some you might want to use:

## [PIB Interactive](https://github.com/The-Politico/template_pib-interactive)
The base template to use when creating interactive templates. Comes with a basic page structure and some placeholder content.

```
$ pit register https://github.com/The-Politico/template_pib-interactive
```

## [PIB Static](https://github.com/The-Politico/template_pib-static)
A specialized template used to create static pages with basic functionality. It has improved load performance over the base PIB Interactive template, but comes with some key limitations when it comes to using certain React features.

If you're curious about using this template for your project, see Andrew Briz or Jon McClure.

```
$ pit register https://github.com/The-Politico/template_pib-static
```

## [Senate Vote Count](https://github.com/The-Politico/template_senate-vote-count)
A template for publishing senate votes on a particular item.

```
$ pit register https://github.com/The-Politico/template_senate-vote-count
```

## [GSpan Template](https://github.com/The-Politico/template_gspan)
A template for creating pages powered by our C Span transcriber and Google Annotation tool: [GSpan.js](https://github.com/The-Politico/gspan.js).
