# **How to use AI2HTML in the politico-interactive-generator:**

Repo w/ artboards and key elements: [https://github.com/The-Politico/tool\_ai2html](https://github.com/The-Politico/tool_ai2html)

### Steps:

1. When creating a new interactive, in your `templates` directory, create a folder called `ai`
2. Place `ai2html-resizer-html` \([https://github.com/The-Politico/tool\_ai2html/blob/master/ai2html-resizer.html](https://github.com/The-Politico/tool_ai2html/blob/master/ai2html-resizer.html)\) into your `ai` directory.
3. Add `{% include "ai2html-resizer.html" %}` at the bottom of your `_base.html` file.![](/assets/Screen Shot 2017-09-29 at 4.17.34 PM.png)

### Exporting artboards:

1. When creating assets in AI, you have a number of different art board sizes at your disposal. You can see the different sizes available to you here: [https://github.com/The-Politico/tool\_ai2html/blob/master/politico-graphics.ait](https://github.com/The-Politico/tool_ai2html/blob/master/politico-graphics.ait)
2. The artboard sizes that are essential for a project are **270px \(width\) for mobile **and then **400px or 600px** \(for iPad\). Our content well on an interactive page is 600px, so unless you are breaking outside of the well, you won't need larger artboards at 7**20px, 945px **or** 1050px.**
   1. A good example of using a larger artboard is when it needs to be lede art like here:  [http://www.politico.com/interactives/2017/trump-travel-ban-muslim-visa-decline/](http://www.politico.com/interactives/2017/trump-travel-ban-muslim-visa-decline/)
3. You need to **delete any unused artboards**, b/c AI2HTML will export them all.
4. Then save your ai file in the `ai` folder and run `ai2html` within illustrator \(Under `File` &gt; `Scripts` &gt; `ai2html`\)
   1. This generates your artboards and a partial \(with the name of your ai project\) in the root of `src`. Your partial is also generated, which you then include as a partial in your `index.html` file.
   2. You can make changes directly in CSS, but Jeremyâ€™s work flow is to make the changes in AI and run the script again, as this will overwrite preexisting files \(including any custom CSS style changes you made\).
