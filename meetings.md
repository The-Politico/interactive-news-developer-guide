# Meeting

Meetings are important. They're also fragile and susceptible to abuse.

By design, we will have few regular meetings and instead emphasize continuous conversations within the team. That is a starting position, from which we will introduce more formal meetings as needed.

### Sit-down/stand-up

Ever Monday at 11 a.m., we'll start the week with a "sit-down/stand-up."

This is our only regular formal meeting designed to be inherently flexible and aggressively to-the-point.

Each meeting is **either** a sit down or a stand up.

#### Stand-ups

If we are simply updating each other on our progress on current projects and outlining our workweek, the meeting will consist of a stand up. Stand-ups last no more than 10 minutes.

#### Sit-downs

Unlike stand-ups, sit-downs should not be extemporaneous. One or more of us will prepare a discussion or presentation beforehand. Sit-downs should emphasize skills over projects and larger strategy over discrete tasks. These are small meetings to encourage us to think larger and grow. They should last no more than 30 minutes.

#### Look-ahead

Each sit-down or stand-up meeting should have 


shouldn't be oriented around specific projects, which should have their meetings. Instead, sit downs should cover new skills we learned, hashing out longer term project ideas.



Both meetings will have a look-ahead component.

* This meeting will be a quick stand-up, unless we have something larger to tackle.

* * What we're working on
  * Ideas for the week ahead 
    * Are there big news events coming next week that we can prepare for?
