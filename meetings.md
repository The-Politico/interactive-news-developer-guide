# Meetings

We'll keep our formal meetings to a minimum in order to encourage informal meetings among team members. This is a highly collaborative team that places a premium on sharing ideas and skills across our areas of expertise

---

Each week at 11 am we'll have a sit-down/stand-up \[ max 30 minutes\] where we'll discuss

* This meeting will be a quick stand-up, unless we have something larger to tackle.

* * What we're working on
  * Ideas for the week ahead 
    * Are there big news events coming next week that we can prepare for?
