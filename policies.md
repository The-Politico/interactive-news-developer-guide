# Policies

These are the essential, enumerated policies of our team.

### Working hours

The goal of this team is to be an integral part of the newsroom. A principal component of that is simply being here when our coworkers need us, so our working hours must overlap with the rest of the newsroom. Team members should be in by **10 a.m.** as a course of habit. We will be flexible as projects need us to be, but the mean we revert to should be a regular morning start time.

### Comp time

Often projects will cause us to work a longer day to meet a deadline. If you work overtime on deadline, you are entitled to claim that time back once you're off deadline.

Some general principles to guide your use of comp time:
- Generally, comp time should **only** be accrued on deadline. We can't let you simply front-load your work hours regularly. That said, if you need to shave a couple hours off of one day for a personal errand on another, that's OK in moderation.
- Comp time due to work outside the office is assessed based on a loose accounting between you and the Interactive News team editors. "Loose" because a strict tally would require more scrutiny over exactly how you spent that time than either you or your editors want.
- Accruing and spending comp time in bulk are both bad for our team. The former risks burnout and will affect the quality of your work. The latter will strain your relationship with the newsroom.

### Working off-site

Sometimes you need to work outside the office, and that's OK. Remote work is inevitable but it also trades against our goal of being responsive to the newsroom, so use it rarely.

If you need to work from home due to a personal errand, like overseeing apartment maintenance or collecting a package, you can. You'll be expected to be available by Slack and, it goes without saying, actually working. Please limit your time away to a partial day like a morning or an afternoon. You must clear off-site time with an editor before the day you intend to take it.

While we want to be in the newsroom on a daily basis, the usual newsroom buzz can also be distracting if you're charging down a complicated project. Taking a "tunnel day" is a way to unplug and concentrate on a specific project deadline. To take a tunnel day, you must set clear goals with an editor and check-in with progress at least once during your day. These are very rare privileges, indeed, but equally useful sometimes to get a project over the line.


### Time off approval

All time off, including comp time, **must be approved ahead of time**. Requesting time off same-day should only happen in exceptional circumstances, medical or otherwise. Please use the company time-off app to request time.



### Code of conduct

Team members are subject to all our corporate policies regarding conduct and interpersonal behavior and should report abuses as specified in company guidelines.

In addition, we'd like to add a few extra guidelines specific to this team's work:

- All ideas are welcome and must be respected that are offered in good faith.

- Orient project reviews, priority debates and other discussions around improving our team's output and POLITICO's journalistic standing.

- No one's work on any one project is more important than the cohesion of the team. Conduct yourself accordingly.

- Any discussion that strays into personal criticism should be ended immediately and not begun again until a superior editor is present.

- Be willing to criticize your code dispassionately, but passionately defend the goals of your project.

- Critically evaluate the process as much as the product. Anything we do once, we'll do again.
