## Start a slack channel (duh!)
We'll use slack to help us manage the project up to publish. The nice thing about channels is people can come and go as they please. 
- [ ] Invite reporters, editors and social media guru `teischen@politico.com`
- [ ] For projects with `mschuler@politico.com`mschuler@politico.com`teis
- [ ] If you have a google doc, pin it to the channel



### Copy editing

- [ ] For large projects, flag the copy desk early.
