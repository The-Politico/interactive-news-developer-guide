## Setting up google authenticator
You'll only have to do this once. Download the a **Google Authenticator**, which you can set up by downloading the app for [Mac](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/google-authenticator/id388497605?mt=8) or [Android](http://cms.politico.com/cms/logIn.jsp). 
 - Register with your Politico credentials. You'll be using these google authentication codes, **every time** you log into the CMS.

##Navigating to a story
- Stories all have unique IDs. Searching by this ID (highlighted below) is the quickest way to navigate to the story. You may also search by slug, key word, headline, byline, etc.

####Searching in our cms is less than ideal. A quick guide
- Selecting the search bar will activate the search panel. 
- Click into **Status (Published)** dropdown and select all of the states by clicking each one individually. They will turn blue once they are elected. This will ensure the CMS surfaces the slug from stories in any stage of publishing.
- Paste in the ID or slug you are looking for into the search bar on the top of the page
