# Keeping a budget

There is but one commandment, and it is this:

    Everything goes in the budget.

_\- Lily and Jon 3:16. _    


The budget is a critical tool for organizing our work with the newsroom. Keeping it up-to-date and accurate is the small price we pay for the privilege we have to manage our own project workflow in the newsroom.

Categorize projects according to our time tiers and be sure to include your partners in the newsroom on project cards.

You are responsible for advancing your own projects in the budget.

### Fielding newsroom pitches

The budget is also an open tool for the newsroom to pitch project ideas to our team.

**It is everyone's responsibility to respond to newsroom pitches.**

We are not a service desk, but we are eager partners. In practice that means that we are responsive to the newsroom but not beholden to their priorities. We will evaluate every pitch on its merits alongside all our other priorities and be clear how we weigh them against each other.

Negotiate any close competitions with Lily and Jon, and be open to the fact you may be too invested in one project to realize a better one. We all do that.
