# Meeting

Meetings are important. They're also susceptible to abuse or becoming stale.

By design, we will have few regular meetings and instead emphasize continuous conversations within the team.

### Sit-down/stand-up

Every Monday at 11 a.m., we'll start the week with a "sit-down/stand-up."

This is our only regular formal meeting designed to be inherently flexible and aggressively to-the-point.

Each meeting is **either** a sit-down or a stand-up.

##### Stand-ups

If we are simply updating each other on our progress on current projects and outlining our work week, the meeting will consist of a stand up. Stand-ups last no more than 10 minutes.

##### Sit-downs

Unlike stand-ups, sit-downs should not be extemporaneous. One or more of us will prepare a discussion or presentation beforehand. Sit-downs should emphasize skills over projects and larger strategy over discrete tasks. These are tightly organized meetings to encourage us to think larger and grow. They should last no more than 30 minutes.

##### Look-ahead

End a sit-down or stand-up meeting with a 5 minute look-ahead outlining what news headlines we should be paying attention to.

### Project meetings

Organize dedicated project meetings as needed.
