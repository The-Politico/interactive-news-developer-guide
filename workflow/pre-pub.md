### Pre-Publish - Who to contact

**SEO, it matters**
For stories with high SEO potential, tap Mitch to help make your slug travel farther. `mschuler@politico.com` / `@mitchschuler`

-

**Flag our social media friends**
Make sure you flag social media - `#social` via email or slack to let them know the run date as early as you can. If you have a google doc or preview link ready, send it along then.
Annie Yu is the Engagement Editor, and will handle engagement assignments for her team`ayu@politico.com` / `@Annie Z. Yu`

-

**Webfolk**

Flag the `#webteam` / `@tp-webteam`    channel in slack that you have an interactive or embed coming. If you have a google doc or preview link ready, send it along then.

-

**Stories running on PRO**
Pro stories will need a *story stub* created. Requests for that should be sent to the `tp-proweb` team, or routed through Jess Cuellar who can help coordinate `jcuella@politico.com` / `@jcuellar`

- A story stub is a truncated version of the story (usually the nut graph + two paragraphs)that runs in the PRO CMS and pushes back to the our more robust build. It also allows the PRO team to push our stories to readerâ€™s emails. 

More on this workflow **here**.
