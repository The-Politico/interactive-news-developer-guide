# Publishing a project

Some simple guidelines for what to do before you hit the big red button.

### Editing process

An Interactive News editor signs off on all projects before they are published or deployed to master. See the publishing checklist for details.

##### Design reviews

An editor will conduct a dedicated UX and design review with you, but editing interactive components should be an iterative process. Show your work early and often to an editor and the final edit will go much more smoothly.

##### Code reviews

Code reviews are required for medium and long-turn projects and for any project touching durable infrastructure like datalab. The format these will take is fluid based on the project.

#### In the case of a large database or story
