# Publishing a project

Some simple guidelines for what to do before you hit the big red button.

### Editing process

An Interactive News editor signs off on all projects before they are published or deployed to master. See the publishing checklist below for details.

##### Design reviews

An editor will conduct a dedicated UX and design review with you, but editing interactive components should be an iterative process. Show your work early and often to an editor and the final edit will go much more smoothly.

##### Code reviews

Code reviews are required for medium and long-turn projects and for any project touching durable infrastructure like datalab. The format these will take is fluid based on the project.

## Publishing checklist

Make sure you've done all these things on your project before you publish.

### Copy editing

* [ ] Ensure that your project has been copy-edited by the correct desk. For Core stories `tp-copyedit@politico.com`. For **PRO stories** `tp-proweb@politico.com`. 

### Meta tags

* [ ] Double check that your `meta.json` file is completely filled out.
* [ ] Triple check that you have the `publishPath` and `url` correctly configured in your publish path.
* [ ] Create a social share image at 600 x 325px, named share.jpg in the `dist/images` directory on interactive pages.

## Documentation

* [ ] Update the README in your project.
* [ ] If you're deploying an app or tool, make sure to add a `Developing` docs section with full instructions for anyone on the team to spin up your project locally.

## Github

* [ ] # Create a private repo for your project and push your latest code \(which you should do daily, tbh\).
* [ ] Prefix interactive and embed repo names with `interactive_` or `embed_`, respectively.
* [ ] Talk with your editor about whether we will make this repo public after publishing.
* [ ] If you're working on an existing project, push your code to a branch which will be merged into master after a code review with your editor.

* If you are working on a graphic, please attach 1-2 options for when the story moves out of the lede spot and into the _b section_.
  * These should be cut to **1160x629**, but will run at a width of ~200px. 
    * Images should have minimal text 
    * They should clearly suggest to the reader that the story has graphical elements. Ie:
      ![](/assets/small.jpg)  or 
      ![](/assets/testings.jpg)

_**Social Medial section**_

### For Embeds

There are **two ways** to get an embed into a story. You **do not need** a story shell for these.

###### **In most cases:**

* Send your `iframe` embed code to the reporter and have them include it with their email to the web team.

  * Send it along with this note:

    * "Please include this embed code with your note to the web team. Ask them to embed it as an `enhancement` into the story. You may specify where you'd like it to go, if you have a placement in mind.

###### 

###### For more complicated builds:

* Embed the code yourself once the reporter is out of the story. To do so, follow [these steps](https://politico.gitbooks.io/politico-newsroom-developer-guide/content/tipsheets/cms-embeds/plugging-your-embed-into-the-cms.html)

  * In the _notes_ field of the cms, mention there is an embed and to contact you with any issues. 
  * Once you've finished, email **webteam@politico.com **to tell them a story with embedded graphics is ready.
