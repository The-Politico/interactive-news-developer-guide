# Starting a project

Good ideas can come from anywhere. Our workflow process has two simple goals:

 1. Keep all creative avenues open to you.
 2. Help you make time management decisions in the open.


### Sources

Talk to our reporters. Read the news. Read books. Watch films. Go to bars. Bring good ideas wherever you find them.

### Project time tiers

We're a small team in the newsroom with the rare privilege of being able to pick our projects. We protect that freedom by being wholly transparent about our priorities.

That starts with an honest accounting of the time commitment we're making to every project.

The following are basic categories we should be able to identify at the outset. They are reflected in the budget and have different guidelines during publishing.

| Level  | Time commitment  |
|---|---|
| Daily   | On deadline  |
| Short-turn  | 2-3 days  |
| Medium-turn  | A week  |
| Long-turn  | Multiple weeks  |

Each sequential level of this scale requires more process transparency than the last. More on that as we go.


### Pre-flight approval

We trust you to identify smart **dailies** and **short-turn** projects. With that trust comes the expectation that you won't surprise your editors. Keep your projects logged in the budget and be eager to talk about what you're working on with Lily and Jon. Often we will come up with our best daily ideas together, so while there isn't a formal pitch preceding these deadline projects, we expect them to have an even higher conversation density than longer term work.

**Medium-turn** projects require a dedicated discussion with Lily and Jon before beginning. We want to know what skills you'll need to learn to complete the project, what data you have in-hand and what you're waiting on, what bottlenecks you foresee, what's your UX aesthetic, shareholders, audience, etc.

**Long-turn** projects require sign-off from Lily, Jon and Paul. Often, you will be asked to write up the goals of these projects and a prospective timeline so we can can track progress.
