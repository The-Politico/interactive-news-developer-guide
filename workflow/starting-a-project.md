# Starting a project

Good ideas can come from anywhere. Our workflow process has two simple goals:

1. Keep all creative avenues open to you
2. Help you make time management decisions in the open

## Sources

Talk to our reporters. Read the news. Read books. Watch films. Go to bars. Good ideas come from wherever you find them.

## Build system

For interactive pages or embeddables, use the latest version of our [interactives generator app](https://github.com/The-Politico/generator-politico-interactives). It is designed to be flexible enough for you to use whatever libraries you need while strictly enforcing the business rules we must have for publishing content.

## For larger apps, please contact c**omms, business analytics, advertising**
